# Pacmen

Why? This project explores how to animate sprites, button useage, how to set boundaries, how to reverse direction, as well as loops and how to connect html elements to JavaScript. 

How to use? Clone this repository to your local system and open the index.html file. Click on the "add PacMen" button, then click "start". You can add additional pacmen to the running program as well as increase the speed of their movement or reset the program. 

What's coming? I would like to add a maze with a start and finish to learn about manipulating sprites using the keyboard. Eventually I plan to build a simple program similar to Pac-Man in order to learn about adding multiple sprites and coding multiple tasks for the sprites.
